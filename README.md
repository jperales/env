## IDE for programming   
### IDE in a nutshell
Programming at the cluster is not that straightforward since there is no graphical
 interface. In contrast, an IDE fully based in the terminal is a powerful tool
 for this task. In addition, important features of a good IDE includes a command-line
 console to run lines of code, and auto-complete sentences as long as you are
 programming.   
Herein it is explained how to set-up such an IDE, so you could develop your project
directly when logged-in the cluster.   
Unfortunately, terminal-based IDE are NOT friendly. It's highly recommended that
you have great expertise with the terminal, `tmux` (terminal client), and `vim` (plain text editor). Fortunately, there are good tutorials on the Internet
(e.g. [vim tutorial](http://www.openvim.com/)).

> **What is this IDE about?** You will have a terminal-based environment with the terminal split in two or three panels. First panel will allow you to program, second panel has an active command-line console session for the language interpreter
(`R`, `python`, `bash`, etc). Optionally, you can open this in a `tmux` panel ,
so you keep a third panel with `bash` terminal for `git`.

IDE for `R` and `python` below:

### IDE Basics installation   
The program [`nvim`](https://neovim.io) is a requirement to be installed in the local/remote machine.
Then, you will need to install some plugins for `nvim`. To initiate the
config of `nvim`, create the following directory if it does not exist yet:
```
if[ ! -e $HOME/.config/nvim ];then
  mkdir $HOME/.config/nvim
fi
```

### IDE command-line interpreters
The `nvim` interface (first panel) communicates with the command-line interpreter allocated in a second panel.

To start the command-line interpreter for any language, you have to install
certain ad-hoc plugins before.

#### R command-line interpreter
You have to install `vim-r`. More [info](https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R)

**Installation**   
Follow these instructions: https://gist.github.com/tgirke/7a7c197b443243937f68c422e5471899

**Usage**    
Open a `*.R` or `*.Rmd` file with `nvim` and intialize a connected R session with `\rf`. This command can be remapped to other key combinations, e.g. uncommenting lines 10-12 in `init.vim` will remap it to the `F2` key. Note, the resulting split window among Nvim and R behaves like a split viewport in `nvim` or `vim` meaning the usage of `Ctrl-w w` followed by `i` and `Esc` is important for navigation.

Important keybindings for nvim (vim):

- `\rf`: opens vim-connected R session
- `spacebar`: sends code from vim to R; here remapped in `init.vim` from default `\l`
- `:split` or `:vsplit`: splits viewport (similar to pane split in tmux)
- `gz`: maximizes size of viewport in normal mode (similar to Tmux's `Ctrl-a z` zoom utility)
- `Ctrl-w w`: jumps cursor to R viewport and back; toggle between insert (`i`) and command (`Esc`) mode is required for navigation and controlling the environment.
- `Ctrl-w r`: swaps viewports
- `Ctrl-w =`: resizes splits to equal size
- `Ctrl-w 5< or 5>`: resizes splits to left or right by 5 steps; change number as needed
- `Ctrl-w H` or `Ctrl-w K`: toggles between horizontal/vertical splits
- `Ctrl-spacebar`: omni completion for R objects/functions when nvim is in insert mode. Note, this has been remapped in `init.vim` from difficult to type default `Ctrl-x Ctrl-o`.
- `:h nvim-R`: opens nvim-R's user manual; navigation works the same as for any Vim/Nvim help document
- `:Rhelp fct_name`: opens help for a function from nvim's command mode with text completion support
- `Ctrl-s and Ctrl-x`: freezes/unfreezes vim (some systems)

#### python, bash, and other interpreters
You have to install `vimcmdline`. More [info](https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline).

**Installation**   
Copy the directories `ftplugin`, `plugin` and `syntax`to your `~/.config/nvim`
directory from this repository: https://github.com/jalvesaq/vimcmdline

**Usage**   
If you are editing one of the supported file types, in Normal mode do:

  - `\s` to start the interpreter.
  - `<Space>` to send the current line to the interpreter.
  - `\<Space>` to send the current line to the interpreter and keep the cursor on the current line.
  - `\q` to send the quit command to the interpreter.
For languages that can source chunks of code:
  - In Visual mode, press:
    - `<Space>` to send a selection of text to the interpreter.
  - And, in Normal mode, press:
    - `\p` to send from the line to the end of paragraph.
    - `\b` to send block of code between the two closest marks.
    - `\f` to send the entire file to the interpreter.

## GitHub as a command-line client
>NOTE: official website https://cli.github.com
Depending on Linux and user permisions, you could follow to alternatives:

- A) If root user, install it from official sources using apt-get install in Ubuntu, more details in https://github.com/cli/cli/blob/trunk/docs/install_linux.md#debian-ubuntu-linux-apt

``` bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key C99B11DEB97541F0
sudo apt-add-repository https://cli.github.com/packages
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh
# If any error, follow the link above
```

- B) If no root user, compile it for local user usage. It is far more complicated:

```bash
# Setting `go` intepreter for compilation
#  Assuming you have a var in bash environment with such as,
#  export SOFTWARE_LOCAL="/beegfs/work/$USER/SOFTWARE"

# 1. Download `go`
wget -O $SOFTWARE_LOCAL/go1.15.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://golang.org/dl/go1.15.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# SHA256 Checksum: b49fda1ca29a1946d6bb2a5a6982cf07ccd2aba849289508ee0f9918f6bb4552
# 2. Extract `go` as a local installation (src: https://golang.org/doc/install)
test -d $SOFTWARE_LOCAL/go1.15.2 || mkdir $SOFTWARE_LOCAL/go1.15.2
tar -C $SOFTWARE_LOCAL/go1.15.2 -xzf  $SOFTWARE_LOCAL/go1.15.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# 3. Export it
# alias go='$SOFTWARE_LOCAL/go1.15.2/go/bin/go'
export PATH=$PATH:$SOFTWARE_LOCAL/go1.15.2/go/bin
# Test it
go -version

# Compile gh program from source
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/cli/cli.git gh-cli
cd gh-cli

# 2. Build
make

# 3. Move the resulting bin/gh executable to somewhere in your PATH or create alias
# sudo mv ./bin/gh /usr/local/bin/
alias gh='$SOFTWARE_LOCAL/gh-cli/bin/gh'
# Test it
gh version
```
Finally, create a auth TOKEN following `Settings> Developer settings > Personal access tokens`.
Add the following permisions (at least, to be cross-checked with official doc):
- admin:org
- delete:packages
- delete_repo
- repo
- workflow
- write:packages

use `gh auth login` > choose Github.com & token auth. Paste it

## Setting up a virtual environment (env)
### In a nutshell
> A virtual environment (aka `env`) is a self-contained local configuration of the basic software (compilers, interpreters, and packages) build-up for a specific use.

This is useful for:
1. **To circumvent outdated libraries from the cluster.** For instance, the GCC compiler is outdated, which is required to compile third-party packages. You are going to face similar issues with JAVA (old v1.6), R (old v3.5). Using `env` you can use an updated compiler to complete the installation of your whole pipeline.
2. **To use different versions of basic environments (R, python).** For instance, some python programs require python 2.7, while other require python 3.0+. You may need to use both versions within a project.
3. **To keep independent configurations for different projects along time.** One research project lasts for years and overlap along time with other ongoing projects. `env` allows you to isolate software configurations across them, so updating packages for one project does not interfere with the settings from other projects.
4. **Share your configuration with collaborators.** You can clone your `env` and share it with your colleagues, so they could reproduce your analysis.

### Installing miniconda3
`miniconda3` is the framework to create and manage `envs`.
Before starting to work with virtual environments (`envs`), you need to install `miniconda3`. **This is done only once**.

Download the installer of `miniconda3`
```
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Create a directory where you are going to install your SOFTWARE
inside your working folder in the cluster

```
mkdir /home/$USER/SOFTWARE/
```

Run the installer and define the installation path. See below.
```
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

# Press <ENTER> to continue an read Miniconda License
# Go down and enter 'yes' to accept Miniconda License
# Importantly! Miniconda2 will be installed into the default location,
# that is your $HOME. However, there is no space in your $HOME at BioQuant.
# Thus, specify another location. For instance:
#	/home/<username>/SOFTWARE/miniconda3
# run conda init when asked during the installation
```
If you didnt run `conda init` during the installation, this is a good time to do so. This will make changes into your `~/.bashrc` file needed to setup the conda environment when needed.

Remove the installer
```
rm Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

### How to use envs
Basically you have to activate the `env` to work with, and deactivate it when you have finished your work.
Since the changes made in the `~/.bashrc` file will take effect only after restart (which doesn't happen very often), to apply the changes you need to run

```
source ~./.bashrc
```
This will start a new bash environment with all profile and path settings needed for conda applied.

To activate an environment,
```
conda activate <env_name>
```

To deactivate it,
```
conda deactivate <env_name>
```

By default, you start with an `env` called `base`. You may give try with it.   
You can also [create new `envs`](#Creating-envs) with your specific configuration.

**Detailed documentation for Conda**  : [further reading](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html)

### Conda channels and recipes
Conda recipes are predefined list of packages with their corresponding dependencies ready to be installed at once in an existing or a new `env`.

There are several repositories (`channels`) throughby you can install these recipes. For instance, [bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/index.html).

Some useful channels that you may add to your configuration are:
```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels r
```

See the next section to understand how these channels can be useful.

### Creating envs
Simply use
```
conda create -n <env_name> <recipe_1> <recipe_2> [...]
```

Where `<env_name>` is a short and unique name for the environment. And `<recipe_N>` is a recipe name from a channel.

Recommendation:
> Use as many recipes as you can from the channels. These are shortcuts to install the package/software with all the dependencies. All bioconductor packages have a recipe...

How-To find recipes:
> You can google `conda <package_name> recipe`. Probably the 1st hit is a recipe from one of the channels (see [Conda channels and recipes](#Conda-channels-and-recipes)).

What if I cannot find a recipe for the package:
> Then you have to install the `env` with the basics so far (e.g. R environment version 3.6, and other libraries and dependencies). Next install the package manually with `env` activated (see [Installing software](#Installing-software) ). You can do this even without running an interactive session on the cluster.

### Installing software in an env
You can install natively software at the same time that you create an `env`. This is very convenient. See [Creating a virtual environment](#Creating-a-virtual-environment).

To install manually any package in the `env`, first you have to activate it
```
conda activate <env_name>

# See that the terminal prompt will show the <env_name>
#   that means it is active
```
When an `env` is activated, some bash environment variables are updated/created:
* `$PATH` - and other bash variables are updated. Thus the priority path to installed binary programs changes, so the binary ones from the `env` are going to be used in preference to the others installed outside of the `env`
* `$CONDA_PREFIX` is a new bash environment variable. `$CONDA_PREFIX` points out to the absolute to the local installation of the programs within the `env`.

#### Quick-guide:
Note that this is an example for `R` packages, but similarly for other languages (python, java, etc).

1. Activate the `env`
```
conda activate <env_name>
```
2. Start `R enviroment` inside the `env`:
```
$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/R
```
3. Install your package as usual (inside `R`). See [Installing R packages](#Installing-R-packages) for detailed information. You can do this even without running an interactive session on the cluster.

### Using an env when submitting jobs
You have to consider two key points here:
* When you submit a job to the cluster, the cluster node starts a new session in UNIX with default settings.
* There are different binaries installed locally in the node. You may prefer to use one in particular. For that, you have to specify which one.

Thus you have include them in your PBS script :
1. Activate the `env` before running your script, adding the following line just after the header
```
conda activate <env_name>
```
Do not forget to add `exec bash` before this line to setup the conda environment, if the changes to the bash environment are still not automatically applied.

2. [Optional] Specify the local program to run your script from the `env` in order to avoid misinterpretations. For instance, for an R script:

```
# Use this one  
$CONDA_PREFIX/bin/Rscript <your_script.R>  

# ... Instead of   
Rscript <your_script.R>  

```
